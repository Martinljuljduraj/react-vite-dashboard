# This is the M Enterprises Dashboard reimagining the Argon Admin Dashboard

It uses React.js, Vite, Material UI with a Dark and Light Mode

Along with the main dashboard page, it displays the teams page with default emails and phone numbers, invoices balance page, profile form page, calendar page, and multiple other charts with their purposes being to display default data.

This is a repo that I took and followed along watching a video, making subtle changes to it and deploying it to Vercel with the framework being Vite.

The calendar on this is fully interactive. I am able to write down a reminder to myself on it via the localhost.

On my end there were alignment issues but I’m sure that it would show up as it’s supposed to when running on server.

Changed up the mock data it was giving me among the various charts. Changed the names in the contact information and names of the Team members were changed along with invoice info.

You can run this on localhost:5173
